quickCand.py
------------

Generated a number of plots for a given Heimdall candidate file: the raw data block, dedispersed pulse profile, decimated in frequency and time.


quickCand2H5.py
---------------

Messily modified version of the candidate plotter to save each incoherently dedispersed pulse sample to a H5 file.

manualDedispersion.py
---------------------

Example script made for some interns to demonstrate how to incoherently dedisperse a block of data.

fitPowerLaw.py
--------------

A script written to fix a power law to the number of pulse candidates, extracted from a Jupyter notebook. Could be re-worked to work for arbitrary number of inputs rather than manually setting up N variables for each observing epoch.
